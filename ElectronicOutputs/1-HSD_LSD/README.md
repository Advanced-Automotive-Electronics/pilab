"There are two basic ways of driving a load (Figure 2). A low-side driver is placed between the load and ground, whereas a high-side driver, shown in 2(b), is placed between the load and the supply voltage. The low-side driver is often used for powertrain-related loads such as motors, solenoids, and heaters. The high-side driver is used for fuel pumps, and body-related functions such as seats, lighting, wipers, and fans.

The two drivers differ primarily with respect to their response to fault conditions. In an automobile, a short-to-ground fault is more likely to occur than a short-to-supply fault, given that grounded sheet metal is everywhere to be found. For a low-side driver, a short-to-ground condition will turn the load permanently on. With a high-side driver, it will short the driver output to ground, so the driver will need protection circuitry.

The opposite condition will apply for a short-to-supply fault: the low-side driver will be shorted to the supply and need protection, while the high-side load will be permanently on.

This differing response is what determines the use of one driver over the other; in a fuel pump with a low-side driver, for example, a short-to-ground as a result of a crash may turn on the fuel pump with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Low-side drivers have been widely used in engine and transmission control since the 1980s, but the widespread adoption of high-side drivers is fairly new. Initial use was in body functions such as electric set motors or mirrors, but more recently the main factor has been the expansion of LED lighting. From its initial use in interiors, LED lighting has spread to turn signals and brake lights, and now is making its appearance in headlights. An automotive LED headlight system typically consists of a high-side smart LED driver controlling several LEDs in a series string."
